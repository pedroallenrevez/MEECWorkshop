# 1. Anaconda / Jupyter

In this course we will be using Anaconda, an easy to install tool, that installs
Python and other needed tools for this course.

Go over https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and download the installer.

Install Anaconda and you are ready to go!

You can open the 'Anaconda Navigator' program, and from there you are able to
launch a 'Jupyter Notebook' which will be our main way of interacting with
Python over this course.

# 2. Slack

Our main way of communicating will be over the Slack app.

Go to https://www.slack.com/downloads/ and download Slack.

After you are finished installing Slack, it will ask you to join a channel.
The channel we'll be using on this course is "meec-pyworkshop".
I've already sent you all invitations to join the channel.
We will be using this for ease of communication between me and you.
You can send me a question anytime during the duration of the course (from 26
October to 09 November).
